  ## What is Bird Watcher?
  
    Bird Watcher is a Bird Feeder with a Raspberry Pi 4 with a camera running balena and Edge Impulse Machine Learning service. This project run Edge Impulse Linux SDK on balenaOS allowing you to manage a fleet of devices.
  
  ## Installation Instructions
  
  ### Hardware and software needed
  
  * Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
  
  * Raspberry Pi Camera or USB Camera
  
  * [Edge Impulse account](https://edgeimpulse.com/)
  
  * [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher/)
  
  
  ### Get Started
  
    Running this project is as simple as click 'Get started` button on this page. Clicking will open a pop-up, introduce the WiFi credentials and generate the balenaOS Operating System image. 

    Once the OS image is downloaded on your computer, open [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher/). Flash an SD card with the OS image downloaded.

    When the flashing process has completed successfully, insert your SD card into the Raspberry Pi 4 and connect the power supply.

    After your device is flashed and powered up, simply open up a web browser on your computer on the same network. Enter the address: [http://birdwatcher.local](http://birdwatcher.local).
    
    To login, use the username `birdwatcher` and password `birdwatcher`. You may change these credentials on `Settings`.

  
  ### Configure the Variables
  
  #### Use your own Edge Impulse ML model
  
  The project will start automatically working with Mithun's original Bird Watcher ML model. However if you would like to re-train your model and improve it, feel free to follow these instructions below:
  
  
  * Go to [Bird Watcher ML model](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/40986/latest) and clone it on your [Edge Impulse](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com) account.
  
  * Go to `Keys` next to `Project Info` menu. 
  
  * Create a new Edge Impulse API Key and copy it.
  
  * Go to [http://birdwatcher.local](http://birdwatcher.local)
  
  * Go to `Settings` and introduce the Edge Impulse API key.
  
  * Now you can start training your Edge Impulse ML model.
  

  Otherwise feel free to create your own Edge Impulse ML model with other topics. Feel free to share innovations you do on the top of this project.

  
  #### Create a Telegram bot and a Channel to share your watched birds
  
  Follow this instructions to create a Telegram bot.
  
  * Download the Telegram application on your mobile phone.
  
  * Search the user `BotFather`. This is the official Telegram bot to create bots.
  
  * Click `Menu` and select `Create a new bot` or alternatively write `/newbot` on the chat.
  
  * Introduce a name for your bot and then introduce a username (using underscores and `_bot` ending). 
  
  * Copy the URL of your bot and the `HTTP API token` which will be the `TG_TOKEN` on the Telegram Variables on Settings.
  
  * Go to Telegram app and create a private Channel and introduce as a subscriber the bot that you have created.
  
  * Open a browser and type `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TG_TOKEN>/getUpdates` (change `TG_TOKEN` by the real one).
  
  * Copy the chat id from the bot and introduce it as a `TG_GHAT_ID` on the Settings.

  
  ### Invite your community
  
    Once you have a Telegram bot URL, feel free to share it with the share it with the community. 
    
    Create a local community with schools and others who would like to learn about birds and nature around them. Involve families, teachers and more.
  
  ### Troubleshooting
  
  If you have any issue feel free to write on [https://forums.balena.io](https://forums.balena.io).
  
  
  #### Local website does not work
  
    If you have more than one device, the device names will increment like so: [http://birdwatcher-2.local](http://birdwatcher-2.local), [http://birdwatcher-3.local](http://birdwatcher-3.local)

    The local hostname requires a multicast DNS (mDNS) service like Bonjour or Avahi:

    * On Windows, check if 'Bonjour' is installed (Control Panel > Programs and Features). If not, you can download Bonjour for Windows from [https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999)
    * Most 'desktop' Linux distributions ship with Avahi. Search for the installation command for your distribution. E.g. for Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
    macOS comes with Bonjour built-in.
